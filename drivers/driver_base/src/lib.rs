//! Device driver interfaces used by [ArceOS][1]. It provides common traits and
//! types for implementing a device driver.
//!
//! You have to use this crate with the following crates for corresponding
//! device types:
//!
//! - [`axdriver_block`][2]: Common traits for block storage drivers.
//! - [`axdriver_display`][3]: Common traits and types for graphics display drivers.
//! - [`net`][4]: Common traits and types for network (NIC) drivers.
